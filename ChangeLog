kio-locate (0.5.0)  2010-02-26 -- Bernd Brandstetter

  * Ported to KDE4

kio-locate (0.4.5)  2006-02-05 -- Armin Straub

  * Search hits with non-ascii characters in the file name always showed up
  with invalid size/owner/group information (fixed by Johan Billing).
  * kio-locate should now compile with gcc-4.1_beta (fixed by Jan Jitse
  Venselaar).
  * Updated to bksys 1.5.1.


kio-locate (0.4.4)  2005-10-19 -- Armin Straub

  + Warn if locate (or whatever is selected) is not installed (suggested
  by Axel K. Braun).
  * Use slocate and rlocate as default when available (suggested by Nicolas
  Degand).
  * Closed a bug preventing the display of items having the same prefix
  (reported by Takis).


kio-locate (0.4.3)  2005-09-15 -- Armin Straub

  * Made the config dialogs more verbose.
  * Replaced the previous screenshot (105K) with a similar one (27K)
  significantly reducing the package size.
  + Added a (crude?) German translation.


kio-locate (0.4.2tvo0.2)  2005-08-21 -- Tobi Vollebregt

  * Hit counting is now recursive.
  * Fixed a packaging bug which caused the helpfiles to be inaccessable
  if installed using the .deb file.
  * Updated to the newest version of bksys.


kio-locate (0.4.2tvo0.1)  2005-07-14 -- Tobi Vollebregt

  + Directory collapsing if pattern matches the directory part of a path.
  + Entries for searching within directories and entries for plain
  browsing of the directories.
  + Added full wildcard support in all patterns (after discussion this seemed
  to be more appropriate than full regexp support for `locate:').
  + Added full regexp support in the filtering patterns with the `rlocate:'
  protocol.
  + A case sensitivity setting in the config page.
  + A `config succesfully updated' or `config unchanged' message is
  displayed after closing the config dialog.
  + Different icons for normal and collapsed directories.
  + Configurable RegExp filtering, using a white list and a black list.
  * Fixed searches within a directory other than root (/).
  * Reduced flickering when listing results.
  * Number of hits displayed in front of a directory, is now exactly
  the number of entries you'll see after you click that entry.
  * `locater:help' now actually works.
  * Updated to the newest version of bksys.


kio-locate (0.4.2)  2005-05-22 -- Armin Straub

  * Removed stupid bug inverting case sensitivity.


kio-locate (0.4.1)  2005-05-21 -- Armin Straub

  + Added a config page for settings related to locate (the real
  one :-)). You can e.g. choose slocate or other replacements now.
  * For compatibility -i is used instead of --ignore-case when calling
  locate.
  * Case Sensitivity is now chosen for every part of the search
  pattern on its own.


kio-locate (0.4.0)  2005-04-10 -- Armin Straub

  + Using scons and bksys instead of autotools and the like. This
  saves both - a lot of space (around 500kb) and lots of time
  when developing (thanks to Nagy Thomas for his help).
  Read INSTALL for a quick guide.
  + Added the possibility to configure some aspects of kio-locate
  by envoking locater:config. (More to come...)
  * Use the locater protocol which uses standard Urls for more
  complex tasks and keep the locate protocol for simple queries.
  * Don't use ilocate and clocate anymore. (Check the settings for
  configuring kio-locate's case sensitivity.)
  * Some minor enhancements and some new bugs :-)


kio-locate (0.3.4)  2005-01-22 -- Armin Straub

  * Removed yet another bug preventing kio-locate from compiling when using
  KDE 3.2 (thanks to Sergio Cambra).


kio-locate (0.3.3)  2005-01-21 -- Armin Straub

  * Removed small bug preventing kio-locate from compiling on some systems
  (thanks to Francesco di Cugno who also provided a package for Slackware).


kio-locate (0.3.2)  2005-01-17 -- Armin Straub

  + Several hits in one directory are now grouped together. For code and
  ideas lots of thanks to Fred Schaettgen.
  * The search process should be a bit faster as only those files are
  checked for existence that are displayed (thanks to Fred Schaettgen).


kio-locate (0.3.1)  2004-12-10 -- Armin Straub

  * The locate protocol no more does only case sensitive searches, but
  searches case insensitive by default and switches to case sensitivity if
  the search string contains upper case characters.
  + Added the protocol clocate for case sensitive searches.
  + Added a locate search to konquerors list of web shortcuts. This enables
  you to select locate as the default search engine in konqueror. (Whenever
  you enter a nonsense url then, konqueror will use locate to search for
  this "nonsense".)


kio-locate (0.3.0)  2004-11-01 -- Armin Straub

  * Filtering by regular expressions is now possible:
  You can use "locate:pattern [!]regexp ..." now. pattern uses standard locate
  syntax followed by regexps that may be preceded by ! meaning that they
  shouldn't match.


kio-locate (0.2.4)  2004-10-26 -- Armin Straub

  * Removed bugs in kio-locate.spec used to generate rpm's (thanks to Sami
  Vento).


kio-locate (0.2.3)  2004-10-25 -- Armin Straub

  * Taking current locale into account, so kio-locate won't change non-latin1
  encoded file names (thanks to Jakub Stachowski).
  + Added kio-locate.spec so that you can build rpms by just typing
  rpmbuild -ta --target=i686 kio-locate_$VERSION.tar.gz (thanks to Sami
  Vento).


kio-locate (0.2.2)  2004-10-24 -- Armin Straub

  + Added the protocol ilocate for case insensitive searches.
  + Interpret ~/ and ~user/ in a search (expand just as the shell normally
  does).
  + Detection of konquerors autocompletion.


kio-locate (0.2.1)  2004-10-22 -- Armin Straub

  + Added french translation (thanks to Laurent Rathle).
  * Included stdlib.h correctly (previously preventing kio-locate to compile on
  some machines).


kio-locate (0.2.0)  2004-10-15 -- Armin Straub

  * Complete rewrite.
  * Works with KDE 3.3.
  + Displays detailed information in Konqueror (not just filenames).
  + Enabled patterns like the ones used for locate.


kio-locate (0.1.1-1) -- Michael Schuerig

  * Corrected URL prefix ("file:" instead of "file:/").
  * Update admin dir.


kio-locate (0.1-2) -- Michael Schuerig

  * Rebuild for KDE 3.1.
